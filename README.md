## GitHub Pages Deployment

This site is configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages. Here's how it works:

1. Push changes to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the site
3. The site will be available at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

### Manual Setup Steps

If you're setting up GitHub Pages for the first time:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings > Pages
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. The deployment workflow will handle the rest

### Local Development

To run the site locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser

No build step is required as this is a static HTML site.
